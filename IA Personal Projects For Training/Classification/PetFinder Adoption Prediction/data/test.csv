Her 2 newborns couldn't walk nor their eyes were open then. 1 male, 1 female kitten. Currently fostering in 1 of the rooms of my place. (my next door neighbour threw a fit when they arrived at their shoe rack first before mine.) They previously had fleas but am confident that they're all gone now as i've been spraying them (using frontline spray). The 2 kittens are now litter-trained and are having solid food and lookin' healthy. Momma is putting on more weight too. Am only able to foster this family as i already have 1 resident traumatized cat who's not gonna be able to live with other cats plus i work outstation/away from home at most times so caring for 4 cats in total is a handful. Have not vaccinated/neutered the mom cause she's has been feeding the kittens. Mom could be about 6-8 months, my best guess. Still a juvenile for sure. The kittens should be about 3 months now. Not vaccinated yet either, pls take note. RM50 is just to help me cover cost for the cat items i've purchased. It's worth much much more than RM50 all put together. I will be giving the food/water bowl, scratch post and pad and DIY litter box and food (if any). These cats can be picked up anytime. Just give me a buzz. If you're looking to have cats of your own, please consider all 3 of them as they are pretty inseparable :) Thank you kind souls.",cf8e714b5,21.0

I can't keep the kittens because I have 2 to take care of with no mother. The Kittens are still nursing, and scared but does not bite or scratch. If anyone is interested in adopting them, please email me and tell me about your experiences with cats. Right now, they are staying upstairs, in the balcony outside. I provide them a cage, but opened. Mum cat will not stay calm in the cage, so I decided to leave it open for her. The little ones sleep inside and Coda sleeps outside. [Update] It's impossible to adopt the kittens now. They are still afraid of human contact. Especially the Calico and Black/white one. They are still nursing with their mother. They can't eat on their own yet. I'll give it 3-4 weeks before they are separated from mummy. I would prefer if all 3 of them are adopted together. I've decided to give them names so it's easier to update. The Golden is Hal. [Male] The Black/white is Joe. [Male] The Calico is Sasa. [Female] [Update] Hal is starting to respond to me when I call him and when I come out to give food. Sasa will roll over but she's scared to come close. Joe will come near if he smells food, and does not mind me petting him. Sasa's fur is so much longer now. All their fur is beautiful and thicker. I will upload more pictures soon. [Update] All of them are good eaters now. Not as scared as before. When I open the door to give them food, they run to me instead of running away. That's a good thing, they are beginning to trust me. I think soon they'll be ready. It's urgent now because I might be out of the country next month. I really need to find someone to adopt them. I can't put them for boarding because they have fleas, and I have 2 other kittens I have to board. That's all the updates for now. [Update] I only want people who are serious to email/message me. A lot of people emailed me and gave me and the kittens hope of finding a home for them, but after sometime they don't reply. I only want what's best for them. DO NOT EMAIL ME SAYING YOU'RE INTERESTED AND THEN BACK OUT WHEN I AGREE TO LET YOU ADOPT THEM. ONLY SERIOUS ADOPTERS PLEASE. IF YOU ONLY ""THINK"" YOU WANT THEM, THEN DON'T BOTHER EMAILING ME. DO THE THINKING FIRST, AND WHEN YOU SERIOUSLY WANT TO ADOPT JOE/SASA, THEN YOU CAN CONTACT ME. Joe and Sasa are very friendly now. They get startled easily, but when you're calm they are too.

He is a good looking and clean dog and we knew he must belong to someone and sure enough we found his fur around his neck was flattened where he had worn a collar for some time. His injury was causing him great pain and we can only assume that his owner abandoned him to avoid costly vet bills. We managed to gain his trust and took him to the vet for treatment. Sadly the vet diagnosed that the injury was too bad to save the leg and amputation was the best option. The newly named ""Nolan"" went through the operation and recovered amazingly well, in fact the vet told us that after such a major operation he was suprised at how well Nolan has recovered and how healthy he is. Nolan is really happy now that the pain has gone and is very lively and acts and behaves as if 3 legs are better than 4! He tries to show that he can do anything a 4 legged dog can do and do it better! He loves his walks and obviously misses human company as he is always asking for strokes and hugs and giving back kisses and licks. He has gone through an awful lot in his life and after going through so much pain and heartache after being injured and abandoned he really deserves a loving and secure home to live in. He would make a great family pet and would fill any home with love and fun and at the same time still be able to keep it and the family safe and secure!

I used to produce many puppies for my owner, and my nipples are proof of that. The humans who took me in now said they only add on to my character. Yes, the nipples are a reminder of my past, but who doesn’t have a past right? The humans tell me I never need to produce puppies anymore. Phew, what a relief! Who can resist me, anyway? Just look at my face! Everyone I’ve met only has compliments for me. They always tell me I am the prettiest thing. I love belly rubs! Sometimes I give myself belly rubs by doing a belly dance. The humans said I am the cutest belly dancer. I also love attention and to be near humans. I love my food, of course! Although the humans said I do not have any problem with my skin, I still get the appropriate food as you just never know as we pugs can easily have skin issues. I love my fellow pugs in this house and also the bigger dogs. I’ve never had a problem learning where to do my business.

Both neutered n vaccinated. Apparently they have been guarding d construction site for more than 5yrs now. I was told that d manager brought them to d site as guard dogs. He had since left d company n left d dogs behind. So d security guard took care of them. Shared his food n shed with them. Since most of d buildings r completed now they didn't want d dogs anymore. They contacted d dog catchers n took them away. After 4 long days...i managed to find out where they were. The very next day..i paid the fine and took them out. At the moment they are boarding at the vet clinic. Mus & Libby are very obedient n gentle. They love being around humans. I hope n pray that someone out there could look beyond their age n appearance n adopt n love them forever. They are very responsive and loving dogs. Please contact: Ms Connie,7fdc9a1e9,2.0

He was fearful but hunger got the best of him and he bravely came near us for a bit of my husband's pie. There was a Jaya Grocer nearby so I dashed there and bought 2 pouches of cat food. While he was gobbling up the first packet, my husband ask ""So are you going to catch it and get it snipped? Better decide now before it gets full and runs off."" Typically, I don't rescue cats who are not in need of help (i.e. not injured) and I trap-neuter-release stray cats whom I've fed for a while and am familiar with. But Chester seemed manageable to catch so I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and took him back to our place. ~Vet Visit - 27 Feb ~ Took Chester to the vet today, with the intention of getting him neutered. At the beginning, I'd thought Chester was female (I didn't get to check him out closely) so the vet enlightened me and informed me that he's male :P And for male cats, it is not recommended to neuter them too early so that their urinary tubes can develop so that they have a lesser chance of getting urinary issues later in life. The vet recommends male cats to be neutered around 10 months or older. This is a new thing I learned today because I'd thought all cats can be neutered from 6 months and above. Well, it can be done, just not recommended. (Note: The urinary issue does not affect female cats) Chester is estimated to be about 5 months old now. Unfortunately, I can't keep him for another 5 months before getting him neutered. So I am boarding him at the vet for the next 2 weeks to try to find him a home, failing which, I will neuter him and release him. Chester is not an aggressive cat. He is fearful of strangers and hisses, which is totally normal, but he does not bite or scratch. Once you softly pat his head, he calms down and stops hissing. Conditions for adoption: 1. Ideally to be an indoor-only cat. This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals. 2. Commit to neuter him at 10 months. Those who are interested to adopt Chester MUST commit to neuter him because this is the only way to control our stray cat population. It also prevents him from spraying around your house and prevents certain health conditions (Google on benefits of neutering cats). 3. Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on his progress until he is neutered. Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to Chester's adoption: De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. Serious adopters only.

When the waiter returned, we asked him about Hiro. Apparently Hiro liked to hang out at the restaurant and for obvious reasons, they didn't want him on the premises. Less than 5 mins after the waiter had taken Hiro away, he came back! This time the waiter took him to the back of the restaurant, which was where I found him, fast asleep on the concrete block housing the aircon compressor. I typically do not rescue cats in situations like this because (1) the cat was not injured; and (2) the cat was not in any immediate danger. But I could see that Hiro is quite friendly, from the way the waiter was handling him so I thought I'd try to find him a home. So home he came with us that day :-) We didn't have a box/carrier to put him in, so we just transported him in the car. He was quite perplexed but he didn't go berserk, like how a typical stray would be. Hiro is now at my vet getting the necessary done: deflea, deworm, vaccination, neuter. Once all these are done (in about 2-3 weeks), he will be ready for his new home! The only condition for Hiro's adoption is that he be kept indoors-only so that he won't run the risk of getting hit by vehicles and it prevents him from getting into altercations with other animals or open to abuse by humans. Updates from his adopter once in a while would be greatly appreciated so that I know he's doing fine :-) Hiro is currently being boarded at my vet in Puchong.

Also, it prevents him from getting into altercations with other animals or open to abuse by humans. 2. To be neutered when he is of age.

Snoopy is currently under quarantine at the vet to ensure she has not contracted any diseases while at the pound. She will also be dewormed, deflea-ed, deticked, and vaccinated before she goes to her new home. If you are looking for a young pup to be an addition to your family, Snoopy is the perfect candidate! The only conditions that I request are: 1. To spay her when she is old enough (approx. 6 months old) so that she doesn't contribute to the stray overpopulation. Here are the benefits of spaying/neutering your pet: 2. To keep her within your house compound and not to let her roam, where she would be in danger of getting hit by vehicles, or risk getting lost or abused by other people. 3. Not to keep her chained up or locked up in a cage majority of the time because this is no life for a dog, or for any living being for that matter. 4.

The residents' committee rejected my proposal to implement Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM) to manage the stray cat population at our condo, and opted instead to engage DBKL to catch them. Working against time, I have trapped and neutered 4 cats, and released them in a nearby kampung with the permission and assistance of the kind gardener at my condo, because we all know what will happen to stray animals when DBKL or other municipal councils get them. Lucy is the 5th cat among those that I've caught and I boarded her at my vet so that she can safely deliver her babies (she was in her late pregnancy when I caught her). Lucy delivered 3 furballs on 18 Oct . They are about 3 weeks old now, 2 light grey ones and a dark grey tabby. Their genders can't be determined yet because they are still so young but do check this space, I will update as soon as we can tell. Lucy will be spayed once her kittens are weaned and she will be up for adoption thereafter. Lucy has a very calm temperament and she's quite docile, so much so that I managed to catch her with no trouble at all. When at the vet for the first time, she was very calm and allowed the vet to examine her without any trouble. I believe she will make a loving pet. I am estimating that she will be ready for adoption around mid-Dec . Lucy's kittens will be up for adoption once they are weaned and gotten their first dose of vaccination, which will be in another estimated 3 weeks. Lucy and her kittens can be adopted individually or together. They are currently boarded at my vet's clinic in Puchong and I can deliver them to their new home within Klang Valley. Conditions for adoption: 1. To be indoor-only cats. This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals. 2. Kittens to be spayed/neutered when they are 5-6 months. Those who are interested to adopt the kittens MUST commit to spaying or neutering them when they reach minimum age because this is the only way to control our stray cat population. There will be a RM deposit required for each kitten, which will be refunded upon proof of spaying/neutering. 3. Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress during the first 3 months or until they are spayed/neutered. Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to their adoption: *Lucy: de-flea, deworm, spay and vaccinate *Kittens: de-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. Serious adopters only.

Vixen was looking a bit blurry because they were asleep when I dropped by to visit, and they all woke up when I opened the cage :-) Please would you give them a home? ~Update 17 Dec ~ I've temporarily named them after 4 of Santa's reindeers :-) Cupid is the most curious of the lot; Comet follows Cupid. Dasher and Vixen are still wary of people but I believe they will come around after a while. Great news!

Details of their rescue can be found here: Hope is a very calm and good-natured dog. He was one of the first dogs that caught my eye when I was at the pound, and I remembered thinking that he would make a good family pet because of his calm and friendly nature. The vet suspects he is either a lost or abandoned dog due to his good nature. He also seems to walk reasonably well on the leash. Hope is currently under quarantine at the vet to ensure he has not contracted any diseases while at the pound. He will also be dewormed, deflea-ed, deticked, vaccinated and neutered before he goes to his new home. If you are looking for a quiet, gentle and calm dog to be an addition to your family, Hope is the perfect candidate! My only conditions are: 1. To keep him within your house compound and not to let him roam so that he doesn't get into the danger of being hit by vehicles, get lost or risk getting abused by other people. 2. Not to keep him chained up or locked up in a cage majority of the time because this is no life for a dog, or for any living being for that matter. 3. To treat him like a family member, not an object to own or discard at whim or fancy. Please contact me (SMS or Whatsapp preferred) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

My initial plan was to TNR Inky but I had managed to rehome one adult black cat previously so I'm hoping I'm that lucky again. If no one wants her in a week, I will have to release her.

Next up is getting them vaccinated and corresponding quarantine period to ensure they're not harbouring any hidden illnesses. They're so far active and healthy, with good appetites. My vet says they are in too good condition to be strays, hence a stronger suspicion that they may have been abandoned. I'm still trying to find them a home where they can be together because they are so attached to each other (we suspect they're siblings), although I am not closed to the idea of getting them adopted separately if really need be. Please do consider adopting them together and give them a second chance at having a family. Adoption conditions: 1. Love them and respect them as you would treat any other person (treat them like how you would like to be treated), provide them access to clean water, healthy food, medical treatments and most of all, give them love and attention. 2. A meet-up between potential adopter and the dogs would be recommended so both can meet each other and see if there's chemistry. 3. Allow occasional visitations so I may see how the adopter and dogs are doing. This will only be once in a while as I respect your privacy. An adoption fee would apply to cover some of their medical expenses. ~Original Post~ I very recently spotted Fred and Ginger near my parents' place. They were not there before, so they must have only just been dumped. Why I suspect that they're dumped pets? They display the following characteristics: 1. They have been in the same spot, out in the open, looking like they're waiting for their owner to return for them. Based on my observation of typical strays, they don't like to be out in the open and prefer to hide, coming out only when they need to look for food. 2. They are friendly; they came right up to me when I got down from my car. Again, looking like they were expecting their owner to come pick them up and take them home. They let me pet them and did not shy away from me at all. Typical strays would just run away when I even step out of my car and will only touch the food after I have driven off. The area where they are at is not safe for them because the people there may call the local council to catch them anytime because they are not stray-friendly at all. And given that Fred and Ginger stay out in the open, they make their presence known because people can see them whenever they pass by. I don't know how old they are, I am just guesstimating that they're around 1-2 years old. Please note that they are NOT purebred German Shepherds but they look like they have some mix of GS in them. They are medium sized, with somewhat short legs (reminds me of basset hounds). Put these features together and you get awesomely cute mixed breeds! I am willing to get them neutered, spayed and vaccinated before they go to their new homes. That is what the adoption fee will go towards. Please find it in your heart to give them a second chance at a home. They've already been dumped once (I suspect); please give them a second chance. If possible, do adopt them together because they are such a lovely couple! (see photo) They don't have much time; I would like to get them off the streets as soon as possible before the people call the local council on them. But I can't do it without securing a home for them first because I cannot afford long-term boarding for them. Please contact me at if you're interested. Genuine adopters only. Thank you.

I responded to the person who posted up a plea for help to relocate them. They are now boarding at my vet's clinic. Heidi will continue nursing her pups for about 2 more weeks then we'll wean them and they'll be ready to go to their forever homes. I am looking for homes for Heidi and her 8 pups. There are 7 males (5 white/cream, 2 brown) and 1 female (brown). About Heidi: She's a great dog. Very calm, gentle and friendly for a stray. Because of her temperament, I'm inclined to think that she's a lost or abandoned dog but I'll never know for sure. But when we were rescuing her and her pups, she never once growled or bared her teeth at us, and I was even able to carry her into my car with no issues, except that she was a bit heavy! Heidi is already dewormed and deflead, and I will get her vaccinated and spayed before she is adopted. On her 8 pups (currently around 1 month old): They are dewormed and deflead. If I manage to secure them homes before they are 2 months old, the adopter will need to take care of their vaccination and MUST agree to spay/neuter them when they are of age (5-6 months). This is of utmost importance in order to prevent unwanted litters. Serious adopters only, and must agree to the simple conditions above. I can send the pups to their adopters within the Klang Valley. Regarding the adoption fee, I am paying for all their boarding and medical expenses from my own personal funds. As such, I would greatly welcome contribution of ANY amount from their adopters to cover some of their fees. This is a long haul case which will require significant funds and any contribution I can get would be most appreciated. Please share to help them find their forever homes! Adopt, don't shop.

Adoption conditions: 1. To neuter him when he is of age (between 6-9 months). This is VERY IMPORTANT as it will prevent stray overpopulation and reduce the number of homeless animals. It is also beneficial to the animal, refer to this link: Please note that there will be a RM deposit required upon adoption, which will be fully refunded upon proof of receipt of neutering.

Conditions for adoption : - Feeding twice a day with high quality dog biscuits(BRIT CARE ADULT SMALL BREED LAMB & RICE) + chicken meat + rice + vege + vitamins(Cod liver oil, calcium) - Plenty of space to run around/ daily exercise - Daily own grooming(brushing) and monthly professional grooming - No caging or tying up unnecessarily - Regular deworming and year vaccinations - Adopter has previously kept a dog - Adopter has a small breed dog that is friendly. Preferably looking for adopter living around PJ area so I can visit him often to keep track of his lifestyle. He/she should also be able to update me often by sending photos.

Just give her a chance and you will understand. My best friend was terrified of her at first, but she still fell for Gredith's charm eventually and wishes she could keep her too. Too bad we already have too many dogs and can't take in anymore. She had a litter of puppies before, hence the TVT, but after 3 shots, it has improved a lot.

At that moment of time the cat was still as lively as ever, seemingly ignorant of its injuries. However last wednesday I found the cat lying weak and limping from a seemingly broken paw, although its wounds were beginning to heal slightly. From accounts of some students, some have witnessed the cat being victim to dog attacks. My friend and I got it to the vet in Semenyih, but unfortunately it was closed. We applied iodine onto its wounds, and I kept it in my room for a few days.I took it back home to PJ in the weekends, and sought help. From diagnosis, the cat was probably ran over more than once by vehicles judging from its injuries, and the fracture is more severe than initially thought of. The cat has fractured/dislocated its shoulder, and it has begin to ossify, which means the bone is beginning to heal in an abnormal position. The cat will be lame for the rest of its life if not corrected, and this will render it defenseless as it hinders its movement (it can only hop now, and tends to lose balance and fall). The bone is now jutting out from the side. The vet recommended surgery as its nerve endings are still intact, in which a pin will be placed in the shoulder to help correct it. However, whether the cat will be able to use the leg after surgery will depend on the impact of the surgery on its nerves. If the surgery is performed after the bone heals in that abnormal position, the bone will have to be broken again to insert the pin. The surgery costs more a thousand ringgit. The vet says if surgery is decided against the cat has to be kept indoors as it is unable to protect itself or hunt for food. I am unable to pay for its medical cost due to financial problems. I have been taking care of the cat in my room. I cannot bring the cat back to my house because my dad has suppressed immunity as a result of chemotherapy, and I am beginning to wheeze as I keep the cat in such a confined space. I have brought the cat to PAWS, the most lenient of all animal shelters to see if they can rehome the cat, but according to policy if the cat has a broken leg it will be promptly put to sleep. I hope the students can help the cat out by: 1. Contributing a little to its medical fees 2. Adopt the cat, or at least look after it. The cat is clean, sensible, uses the cat litter well, very sociable and is not hostile towards other cats. It is pretty vocal and clingy though. I really need your help. The photo is a misrepresentation of its injuries, we mistakenly bandaged the paw thinking the paw is fractured. It also hides all its flesh wounds from view. Contact number:",5a9356966,1.0

We as the rescuer never think of giving up him. We tried another 2 vets, same results we got. We decided to let it have a try on the animal acupuncture as recommeded by 1 of the vet.

She is the sister of Willy Wonka (please refer to my other listing). She was a stray kitten. I rescued her from a sewer drain when she was 4 months old. She was very wild then. It was a muracle that i managed to rescued them (3 siblings) after being trapped for 4 days. I called bomba & spca but as the hole was too small, they couldn't come for the rescue. Anyways, Alhamdullilah thank God they are safe. She is a cutie with beautiful stripes. She is bow legged and walks like a cowgirl (hihihi). Small size but fat. Scared of other humans but very affectionate (manja) to me. She is most of the time indoor but she does have a few hours outdoor. She always comes home when i call out ""mamam"" meaning makan or eat (typical cat). She is also a runner. When i open the door she will dash out like lightning but as she grows up here, she knows the neighborhood and will always find her way home. She is potty trained. As far as i know she never does her business either outside my house or inside. She loves her wet food and can be aggresive during meal time. She also eats dry food. If u want to adopt her, please make sure that u can keep her indoor/in a cage so that she can familiarise with your house. I am afraid she can't find her way back to ur house.

From the first moment I saw him, I knew he is to be called Forest. He had a sad story...from what was heard in the neighbourhood, Forest was either abandoned when owners shifted, or chased away when owners bought a new car. Either way, the previous owners must have been real losers and may God have mercy on them. I've grown so fond of Forest in the past few weeks that I've cared for him. He is now vaccinated and dewormed. Sadly, he still lives outside as a stray as my parents would not allow another dog in the house. Forest lives outside my gate in a flimsy ""house"" of umbrellas. He gets wet each time it rains and my heart prays and cries for him each time. I am in the midst of looking for a place of my own but it will take another 3-6 months. I am hoping to find a temporary fosterer so Forest can have a proper Home first and I can arrange for him to be neutered then. I cannot imagine if DBKL were to come. I NeeD to get him off the streets - fast! Therr are SO many other strays I wish to help. Let Forest be one of them! Please call me if you can temporarily foster Forest for me. Will be eternally grateful. My name is Siew Leng and I am available at. Thank you & God bless you.",436e6a9f1,5.0

The vet suspected it may be pheumonia or hernia and treatment was given immediately. She responded well to the treatment but further check up(ultrasound)is required in order to get back her health.

No idea how he got there but I made my first ever call in my life to the Bomba to help get him down. He was only a month old back then. He is very active & healthy and has made a close bond with Jack. Jack Sparrow, the one-eyed cat. He was the only litter left after being born a stray, his mother was too ill to nurse him and he has already developed severe eye infection. After about 2 weeks being with his new mother, I decided to help him ease his suffer by removing the infected eye which no longer can be function as usual. It was a success despite he is still in the young age(a month old). Adopter requirement: Must adopt both together (They are really close to each other after what they have encountered) Treat them as one of your family members Never abandon them when they get old or sick Free roaming indoor with cat-proved environment Good food & love Neuter them when they reach 6 months old (Fees charged in this list are meant to get them neuter, money will be return once the adopter shows proof of sterilization of them both. I can even recommend you the cheapest neuter fee in the town if you need one) Would love to have adopter who would frequently update me about their wellness. I love them like my own babies. Reason to let go: I'm basically an independent rescuer who work really hard, who paid so much effort & money to help the strays in our society. Your kindness of adopting instead of buying will help me rescue more and able to attend to the needy.",e5cb4272e,5.0

I wouldn't have known there's a puppy if she didn't stuck out her head and gave a little yelp. There's no collar on her. I brought her to the vet and was informed that she's only about 8 to 9 weeks then. She was really bloated as well with a little flu, so the vet prescribed her with some antibiotics and gave DMG as well as some vits. She just received her first jab last month after full recovery. Sookie knows how to pee and poo on newspaper, but not consistent enough (that's because she's lacking training, which is entirely my fault). She has separation anxiety; would jump on me when i return from work but it has been toned down a lot. She loves to sleep in the same room as me and loves a good run. She loves chewbones and ball; understand ""sit"" and ""no"" and ""down"". She's a smart pup; with patience and time, she could be quite easy to train. I'm looking for someone who has experience and wanted to keep a dog permanently. I would love to keep her but I already have two aging cats and they are quite upset with a new addition into the family. Besides,there's no one at home who could care for her while i'm away for work. Here are some conditions (to ensure that she finds a good home):- 1) Someone at home to care for her at all times. She must't be left alone for too long. 2) Someone who lives in a terrace (preferably) or willing to bring her to a garden. She loves a good run. 3) Ensure that she is spay and does not breed. 4) Would not mind if I keep in touch with the new owner for Sookie's update.

I suspect she is an abandoned pet as she is well socialised and a placid cat. She came into care with her 2 kittens who are very small despite their age. She is ready to leave the now and go to her forever home. She has started flea treatment-although we found no fleas. She enjoys sitting in the sun and looking at her kittens from a high distance. She still cleans them and puts up with them playing with her tail. According to the vets the kittens are over 3 months old. I took BB in as an emergency as other cat lovers were frightened of her or or kittens being run over in a busy car park that they were living in. I cannot continue to Care for BB as all my family are allergic to cats/dogs. I am hoping to rehome to a forever home for BB and the kittens. As the kittens might have to be Neutered/spayed before trehoming it might be a little longer before they are ready. I don't want to have to release BB back to the shop houses as I still worry about her safety-but I do have to think about the long term health of my family. BB deserves to find her forever home.

She is just a baby that time and her right eye seriously injured. Her mom and they all seems like feel safety downstair our hostel, so we start feeding and playing with them everyday. We tried to play with her but she seems afraid of human. So, that time she always hide behind her mother or sisters (her sisters play with us). One night (bout one week after we found them), we’re back from dinner and try to look for them but I heard from people work around here that her sister dead in the car accident. =( [we just play with her before go out for dinner] We were in a shock and sadness after we get the news. Few days after, as usual morning we go down to feed them and we only found miao miao and we couldn’t see miao’s mother anymore. As the days pass by, she grew elder and gain weight. The workers of shops all around know and like her very much. They always help us to find miao when she’s playing out of our sight. Since she grew elder and mature age, she will attract male cat to “sexual harass” her. We tried to get her unable to give birth by wanted to have the operation but she caught a cold and she cannot get her operation in such condition. While worry she will be pregnant under male cat’s attack when we’re away, we decided to bring her up to our hostel. We bath her until snow white first then prepare the sand for her. She seems a little bit not used to the hostel at first caused she used to run everywhere at downstair =) Til another day we bring her to vet for check up, the Vet told us that she is already pregnant!! Another shocking news for us, the Vet ask us whether we want to give her a check on leukemia and AIDS caused it can affect the baby cat of miao miao. After our consideration, we decided to run that test. Thank god! She don’t have AIDS but with Leukemia which will caused her immune system weaker than normal cat. Since this will pass to the baby cat, and we decided not to let few cats to suffer like her mom anymore we asked doctor to take the baby away from her and make her unable to be pregnant again. The Vet told us that it carry certain risk as miao has leukemia. That day, miao stay in the clinic and has her operation on the next day. Again, thank god ~miao is safe and the operation is very successful. But now, we faced problem from hostel management and also pressure from parent and have to let it go from us. Is anyone out there willing to give her your love and care? Please help her~ She need a home =( Who wanted to see her picture can add anggel. in facebook~ Thanks~~~",79773f498,4.0

I'm also returning to my home country shortly and looking for new home for those lovely cats. - They're bigger than normal domestic shorthair cats. But don't let the size full you. They're all very gentle and loving. :) - They take bathe quite good. Not once I got scratched while I'm bathing them (even some friendly, breed cats scratch you during bathe). -I'm not very sure about cats' age. They're all 2,3 years and above. 1. Boe (Female, neutered) She is very, very friendly to people, even to strangers. Playful and very cute. You'd know she's a female from looking her acting. :) 2. Mochi (Male, sprayed, vaccinated) When you look at mochi you would be reminded of Garfield the cat. He's a chubby cat but also likes to play with toys. 3. Pea (Male, sprayed, vaccinated) This beautiful cat is quite big but he is the most gentle cat I ever seen. He's shy but opens up easily to women. When he does he gives you kitty massage. Green eyed and gray colored pattern are not very normal for domestic cats. 4. Shorty (Male, sprayed) Shorty's name is for his short tail. He used to be abused before he came to my friend, so he gets easily scared especially by men. He reacts better for women but it still takes time for him to open up. Still, he doesn't attack anyone, if he's really scared he just hisses, that's all. He's one shy but lovely cat and sometimes surprise you with cute friendliness once he knows you're a good person. All you need to do is to give him enough time to settle and to know no one is abusing him anymore. 5. Tols (Male, sprayed) This one is a cat that acts like a dog. He likes to stay on your lap and follows you around. Very playful and fun. I think he's one of the rare cats who actually enjoy bathe (but only in warm water ;) ). If you are interested in any of them or need any information or pictures, please email me or call/sms at.",0488bf707,5.0

After awhile I grew very fond of him because he's such a doll and I felt sorry for him for not having a home of his own. He's generally a good cat. Very affectionate and likes to be around people. He'll come running when you call his name. I think he would make a fabulous pet and companion. He is able to co-exist with my female cats without much fuss. The reason why I need to find a new home for him is because he doesn't get along with my male cat. I recently castrated him (my cat) and now Soya bullies him. He is very lovable and loves to be petted. He's not a fussy eater either and makes a good outdoor cat as well as an indoor cat. If you're interested please let me know. But I only want a responsible animal lover and not a so-so owner for him. I need to know that he'll be well cared for and not neglected later on. Edit: Although I think he would do fine indoors but I would like him to have a home where he is allowed access to the outside world. Preferably with a lawn. I have also added some more pictures of him so you can have a better idea of how he looks like. Edit2: The person who decided to take him changed her mind. Soya is still up for adoption. If you feel you can give him a good life please email me or sms me asap. Thank you.,58897f560,6.0

I was outside with my cats, just enjoying the afternoon air. I saw him peeking from outside the gate at my cat Angie. Then he saw my foster kittens running around. He jumped inside. He looked harmless and so I let him be. I didn't think he would stick around but I was wrong. He is so very tame and affectionate which causes me to believe that he is someone's cat. But he was so skinny so I suspected that he was lost. The odd thing was that he looked at me like he knew who I was but I have never seen him around before. He even went about approaching my cats like he was family and was none too shy to attempt play with the kittens. It appears to be that he came from a multiple cat household/family. He stayed for 2 days and wouldnt leave. Fearing that someone might be looking for it, my mom and I decided to place him at this one area where we believed he might have originated from (considering several factors) in hopes that he would find his way home. Surprisingly, after a day he found his way back to my house! This prompted me to think that he may have ran away instead of gotten lost because he had found his way back to my place (I took him to that other area by car and at night so he couldn't have known the route- or so I thought). I surely hope that he wasn't abandoned by his previous owner and that is why he refuses to go home. I tried looking around for his owner but nobody seems to know where he came from. He's a very dear and loving cat. Likes to brush against people's legs and is obviously familiar with humans and other pet cats. He's not stunningly beautiful but he's got a soft friendly face and a BIG nose! =p. C'mon, Barbara Streisand has a huge nose and she's adored by many! Since no one has come forward to claim him and he wants to be someone's furkid, I've decided to put him up for adoption to anyone willing to give him a loving home. Unfortunately I cannot keep/foster him myself because I have reached full capacity for cats at my home for the time being. So I do not have the space nor the means to care for him. Adoption fees are for precautionary measures to make sure he doesn't get any joy/irresponsible adopters. He will be vaccinated and dewormed with that money. Strictly for animal lovers only who believe in the act of neutering. IF I can find donations to neuter him first I will do that before he goes to a new home. If not, you must promise to neuter him. He MUST be a FREE ROAMING cat either indoor, outdoor or both. I do not agree in caging animals unless for safety purposes or temporary health issues so if you plan to keep him in a cage 24/7, I'm sorry I will have to say no. Please understand that I will ask questions to see if you are suitable for the cat. It is not that I want to be unreasonable or difficult but I want what is best for the cat. Those interested please contact me preferably through email. Better yet, if this is your cat or you know the owner of this cat please let me know. Hopefully with sound proof that he belongs to you or that someone you know. Thank you.",04d2ba57a,4.0

A little patience is required for them to settle in and get comfortable with new human friends. They're cute and a joy to watch frolicking around with each other and other friendly cats. They are litter trained and would make good indoor cats. Email if you're interested. Thank you. Requirements: - No 24/7 cage confinement. - Cat-friendly home. - Must promise to vaccinate and neuter when they are old enough. - Must not be used for breeding. - Should be fine keeping in contact with me and giving me updates on their condition. For that I will need your contact details.,29b2024e9,8.0

So this 'young' ciku is looking for love again. He deserves a good home after all he has been through. _______________________________________________ This old boy was abandoned in SPCA. Most likely due to his age. Thorough blood test (including heartworm) were done by private vet. He's certified healthy & in fact he doesn't look like 10 (must be the botox ;-)) The only tell tale sign is he has a few teeth left. He has been given an annual jab for heartworm and I'll get him vaccinated & neutered as well. What I know about this fella - * excellent temperament * good with kids especially young ones * still playful * has a 'territory marking' problem (can be fixed with lotsa of love and patience) * not toilet trained (again can be taught through consistent routine) I am hoping that someone with a big heart can take him in and let him feel loved again. It's not easy for an old dog to get a second chance. In fact his chance would have run out if I didn't take him out of SPCA & foster him. That special someone ideally should have some experience with dogs bcoz points 4 & 5. Most importantly he/she should stick with / by him through thick & thin. Please help me spread the word and call me if interested.,33782f0e0,8.0

It was contentedly chasing bugs and playing among the litter. I brought it home to observe for a couple of days, hoping for the mother cat to appear (no such luck). Perseveringly charming and 'humble' to the others, he has managed to win the trust of my other 3 cats in 2 weeks. It is Teddy's modus operandi to go up to a stretched-out cat on the floor and snuggle up to pseudo-nurse. Even though all my other cats have been neutered, I think instinct kicks-in upon this nursing action to calm the nerves of all concerned. So Teddy now has 3 pseudo-moms who will groom him and allow him to snuggle up to them! Monti, my oldest male cat, plays the part of big brother (sometimes mother!) and seems to be the most tolerant of Teddy, allowing him a wide measure of freedom for mischief. Unfortunately, I can't keep Teddy permanently due to space constraints and I worry that 4 full-grown cats under one roof may be a little too much to ask of my feline friends.

Am not too sure about the gender as I'm not really a cat person... She tends to cry from time to time, perhaps it's because she is bored in the cage (we have a dog running around the house so have to keep her in cage) or just plain scared in a new place... But it's not loud or too long, after crying for a few minute she will then be quiet sleeping or playing on her own... Her tail is a little bent on the tip but all else is healthy and fine... Her claws are pretty sharp and will use them if she is in shock (eg : showering, hair drying, dog got too close) but I guess cat lovers should already be aware of cat's sharp claws... other than that, she is pretty sweet and cute as she likes to play and purr... ^_^",63ecee81a,11.0

I am looking for people to adopt these 2 female dogs, Jane (black and brown) and Julia (white with black specks). They are currently approximately 3-4 months old. The sisters were adopted 2 months ago. I found them in a box at the market. Death was knocking on Julia's door due to a viral infection but I sent her to the vet for a few days and nursed her back to health, and now she is the more active of the pair. Both Jane and Julia are very smart puppies, learning to recognise their own names merely just after 1 week! They are loving and friendly dogs, and like to lick their owners when they are out from their cage. They are potty trained to pee and poop on newspapers (so don't leave any new newspapers/magazines lying around!). Also, they understand simple commands like ""come in"", ""go out"", ""NO!"" (as long as you teach them where is ""in"" and ""out""). Julia is a very smart and curious dog, likes exploring the surrounding and trying out new stuffs. On the other hand, Jane is the contrast of Julia. Keeping more to herself, she is very obedient and more gentle, a huge contrast to her sibling. Though the two dogs are opposites of each other, they love each other, and more importantly their owners very much. I am looking for people who would like to adopt them as I already have 2 dogs in my place and we don't have the time and resources to take care of them. Though they may be mixed breed, they are good and loyal dogs and I hope that you would kindly take them in as a family. I can be contacted at (Madam Lee). Even if you don't want to adopt them, can you lend a helping hand by sharing this post? It will surely help a lot if this post can reach a lot of people by your sharing.

I've rescued them from the street when they were only two weeks old. I have cared and loved them the whole way. However, due to some personal reasons, I can no longer keep them with me. Charlie is very friendly and demands head scratchings almost everyday. Pine on the other hand, is quite reserved and prefers to spend his time alone in some quiet corner. However, these two are inseparable, and Pine is very protective towards Charlie, so please only consider adopting if you can take them together. Charlie's coat is naturally fluffy, while Pine has shorter fur. But, I recently shaved them into lion's cut for flea treatment that they got from the pet boarding (fleas fully exterminated guaranteed!) I will charge no adoption fee, however, these are my terms and conditions: - only adopt if you are willing to keep them indoor after adoption, as they have been indoor cats all their lives. From there on, if you wish to train them to go outside more, it is up to you. Please allow them to adjust. - Adopter must be from within peninsular only, as I'd like to see their new potential home first. I really want to make sure that the adopter is serious. - Please do not cage them, unless for quarantine. - if under any circumstances, you do not want to keep them anymore, please return them to me. I will take them back with no question asked. These babies are perfectly healthy, and they have been trained to use their litter. They will be scared and reserved in the beginning, but once they open up to you, they will bring you so much joy and love you. I hope that you too can give them all the love and care that they need, so that they can forget me. :(",1a47e586c,5.0

She would walk with me to my office to make sure I got there safe from the pitch dark car park, before making her way elsewhere. Dolly is a very sweet, adorable and mild mannered dog. I've been giving her food for the past 2 weeks or so, bit she was more interested in some TLC and playing with me rather than the food! From the way she behaves, it seems like she used to have an owner.. so she is either lost or abandoned. Currently Dolly is being fostered by one of my colleagues who is kind enough to take her home until someone gives her a forever home. She is currently at my friends house in Bandar Sunway, PJ. Not sure of the age since I'm not too familiar with dogs, but I am guessing she is less than 2 y/o. Currently, Dolly is at my friends house in Bandar Sunway, PJ. The Adoption Fee is only a deposit to ensure she is neutered. It will be refunded once the dog is neutered",d7c605337,6.0

We can't keep her due to my allergies and the uni hostel's strict rules. She is currently temporary staying with my friend's house in Sri Kembangan with her other cats. Took her about 4 days to get used to my friend's cats, but once she gets attached to you she will stick with you like a glue. Very adorable. I name her Nai Nai for now, she loves to play and would ask you to play with her, she likes to chat with you, likes hugs and snuggle. She's afraid of heights but likes to climb around. She can eat both dry and wet food (or mixed if you want to), even a fried fish. She likes to massage on you whenever she's on your lap and would curled up. One time, on our way bringing her to Sri Kembangan, she was really uncomfortable and scared in a moving car, so I wrap her with my sweater and she instantly fall asleep (this might come in handy for you).",0aabc201c,2.0

My dog is around 3 months old right now, still growing and I need to find him a new owner ASAP. This is because the puppy had began to lose some fur and it now has a minor skin infection, but my father wouldn't take it to the veterinary because he thinks that this is a waste of money.If you were to ask me, my pup has got a beautiful sets of teeth and paws, he's actually cute cute himself. The puppy itself is actually very cute and quite energetic for people out there who loves to be around outdoor. The reason for me to post this ad is because I'm a uni student currently having my sem break and I'm afraid that my Dad might abandon the dog somewhere near the factories or worse at the construction company that he is working in. The environment near the construction itself is worse, and the Vietnamese and Myanmar foreign workers have been known to slaughter stray dogs including those around the construction sites for protein as they couldn't afford any meat. Puppies like these will be killed for their meats. I have no doubts of this. I'm seriously hoping to look for a new owner for this pup before my new semester kick starts.

As we have invested much time, effort and affection on Gula and our other dogs have acclimatized to Gula, my family has decided that he become a member of our family so he can continue with his treatments and have the stable influence of our other dogs. My apologies and heartfelt thanks to the kind persons who offered Gula a home and I hope you will find your doggie buddy soon.",7c30bce68,5.0

He has bipolar eyes (blue and brown), a common feature in Siberian Huskies. I am very saddened to put him up for adoption because I will be going to Australia to work for long term. Therefore, I'm looking for responsible and pet loving owners to adopt him. Rex knows all basic commands sit, stay, down, No, good boy etc. and is very gentle towards people. Unfortunately, he goes slightly wild when he sees a cat or a female dog. He has not been spayed because I never believed in removing the manhood of an animal for our own comfort. With proper training and discipline, he will know its boundaries. However, because I have been his master all his life, there is a possibility that he will be stubborn towards its new owners. But every living being with a conscience that moves to a new environment will slowly adapt, he needs to know who his new master is and that is where you slowly and gradually train him to understand you. It takes time. My journey and time with rex has been one that is full of joy and I will miss playing and bringing him for walks. Thanks for reading this and I really hope someone is willing to adopt Rex and give him the attention and love he needs. Edit: I have found a new owner for Rex.

Before that, here are some information on them. The momma cat is Tachi, she's about 8-9 months old. She's a momma cat to the 4 kittens. The first one is Bieber. He is the whitest of all. He's shy and a bit scared of strangers. But he's the handsome one :) The second one is Koko. He's the brownish of all. He's a bit fierce when he's hungry. He got defensive easily but he is absolutely adorable and loves to play. He got some spot/dots near his mouth, on his lips. The third one is sweet Shizu. She's a girly girl. The only one of them 4 that loves to clean herself. She got lean body, short hair and very neat baby girl. And the little one of all is Little Oyo. We named him that because of all 4, he was the smallest in size and shapes. And he's different, he got black spots on his body, and he's the most friendly and ""manja"" of all. And he's not scared of anything. We've got to find new home for Bieber and his 2 brothers, Oyo and Koko, and his sister Shizu. I brought the kitten to a vet for fleas, and the vet told me that the kitten is a mix of domestic + siamese + persian. The kitten is the case of accidental pregnancy. We were planning on neutering his mother, Tachi but we got beaten by the male stray cat. She was a baby and we didn't expect the male cat would break into our home and do her. sobs. poor Tachi. Nonetheless, we still love the kitten, but we don't have space, time and funds to take care all of them, so we're trying our very best to find a good home for them. We hope if anyone of you out there could adopt them, do let me know and contact me. Thank you for your time and consideration.",a691ef2a1,6.0
