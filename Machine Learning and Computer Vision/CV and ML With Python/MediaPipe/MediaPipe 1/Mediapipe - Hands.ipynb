    "\n",
    "A machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model. Machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data science teams, the production pipeline should be the central product. It encapsulates all the learned best practices of producing a machine learning model for the organizationâ€™s use-case and allows the team to execute at scale. Whether you are maintaining multiple models in production or supporting a single model that needs to be updated frequently, an end-to-end machine learning pipeline is a must.\n",

    "## ML Pipeline of the MediaPipe Hands: \n",
    "\n",
    "MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer **21 3D landmarks** of a hand from just a single frame. Whereas current state-of-the-art approaches rely primarily on powerful desktop environments for inference, our method achieves real-time performance on a mobile phone, and even scales to multiple hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tracked 3D hand landmarks are represented by dots in different shades, with the brighter ones denoting landmarks closer to the camera.*\n",
    "\n",
    "MediaPipe Hands utilizes an **ML pipeline** consisting of multiple models working together: A **palm detection model** that operates on the full image and returns an **oriented hand bounding box**. A **hand landmark model** that operates on the cropped image region defined by the palm detector and returns **high-fidelity 3D hand keypoints**. This strategy is similar to that employed in our MediaPipe Face Mesh solution, which uses a face detector together with a face landmark model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing the accurately cropped hand image to the hand landmark model drastically reduces the need for data augmentation (e.g. rotations, translation and scale) and instead allows the network to dedicate most of its capacity towards coordinate prediction accuracy. In addition, in our pipeline the crops can also be generated based on the hand landmarks identified in the previous frame, and only when the landmark model could no longer identify hand presence is palm detection invoked to relocalize the hand.\n",
