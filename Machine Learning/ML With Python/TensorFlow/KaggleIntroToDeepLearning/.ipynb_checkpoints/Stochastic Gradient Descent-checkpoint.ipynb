    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two lessons, we learned how to build fully-connected networks out of stacks of dense layers. When first created, all of the network's weights are set randomly -- the network doesn't \"know\" anything yet. In this lesson we're going to see how to train a neural network; we're going to see how neural networks learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all machine learning tasks, we begin with a set of training data. Each example in the training data consists of some features (the inputs) together with an expected target (the output). Training the network means adjusting its weights in such a way that it can transform the features into the target. In the 80 Cereals dataset, for instance, we want a network that can take each cereal's 'sugar', 'fiber', and 'protein' content and produce a prediction for that cereal's 'calories'. If we can successfully train a network to do that, its weights must represent in some way the relationship between those features and that target as expressed in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the training data, we need two more things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"loss function\" that measures how good the network's predictions are.\n",
    "- An \"optimizer\" that can tell the network how to change its weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how to design an architecture for a network, but we haven't seen how to tell a network what problem to solve. This is the job of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function measures the disparity between the the target's true value and the value the model predicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different problems call for different loss functions. We have been looking at regression problems, where the task is to predict some numerical value -- calories in 80 Cereals, rating in Red Wine Quality. Other regression tasks might be predicting the price of a house or the fuel efficiency of a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common loss function for regression problems is the mean absolute error or MAE. For each prediction y_pred, MAE measures the disparity from the true target y_true by an absolute difference abs(y_true - y_pred).\n",
    "\n",
    "The total MAE loss on a dataset is the mean of all these absolute differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VDcvkZN.png\"/>\n",
    "*The mean absolute error is the average length between the fitted curve and the data points.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides MAE, other loss functions you might see for regression problems are the mean-squared error (MSE) or the Huber loss (both available in Keras).\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the model will use the loss function as a guide for finding the correct values of its weights (lower loss is better). In other words, the loss function tells the network its objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optimizer - Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "We've described the problem we want the network to solve, but now we need to say how to solve it. This is the job of the optimizer. The optimizer is an algorithm that adjusts the weights to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all of the optimization algorithms used in deep learning belong to a family called stochastic gradient descent. They are iterative algorithms that train a network in steps. One step of training goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample some training data and run it through the network to make predictions.\n",
    "2. Measure the loss between the predictions and the true values.\n",
    "3. Finally, adjust the weights in a direction that makes the loss smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then just do this over and over until the loss is as small as you like (or until it won't decrease any further.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rFI1tIk.gif\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Training a neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration's sample of training data is called a **minibatch** (or often just **\"batch\"**), while a complete round of the training data is called an **epoch**. The number of **epochs** you train for is **how many times the network will see each training example**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation shows the linear model from Lesson 1 being trained with **SGD**. The **pale red dots** depict the entire training set (epoch), while the **solid red dots** are the **minibatches**. Every time SGD sees a new minibatch, it will shift the weights *(w the slope and b the y-intercept)* toward their correct values on that batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch after batch, the line eventually converges to its best fit. You can see that the loss gets smaller as the weights get closer to their true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Learning Rate and Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the line only makes a small shift in the direction of each batch (instead of moving all the way). The size of these shifts is determined by the **learning rate**. A smaller learning rate means the network needs to see more minibatches before its weights converge to their best values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **learning rate** and the **size of the minibatches** are the two parameters that have the largest effect on how the SGD training proceeds. Their interaction is often subtle and the right choice for these parameters isn't always obvious. (We'll explore these effects in the exercise.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, for most work it won't be necessary to do an extensive hyperparameter search to get satisfactory results. **Adam** is an SGD algorithm that has an adaptive learning rate that makes it suitable for most problems without any parameter tuning (it is \"self tuning\", in a sense). **Adam is a great general-purpose optimizer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Search for Adam Algorithm later to learn more*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding the Loss and Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining a model, you can add a loss function and optimizer with the model's compile method:\n",
    "\n",
    "``model.compile(\n",
    "    optimizer=\"adam\",\n",
    "    loss=\"mae\",\n",
    ")``\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we are able to specify the loss and optimizer with just a string. You can also access these directly through the Keras API -- if you wanted to tune parameters, for instance -- but for us, the defaults will work fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "``What's In a Name?\n",
    "The gradient is a vector that tells us in what direction the weights need to go. More precisely, it tells us how to change the weights to make the loss change fastest. We call our process gradient descent because it uses the gradient to descend the loss curve towards a minimum. Stochastic means \"determined by chance.\" Our training is stochastic because the minibatches are random samples from the dataset. And that's why it's called SGD!``\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example - Red Wine Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know everything we need to start training deep learning models. So let's see it in action! We'll use the Red Wine Quality dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of physiochemical measurements from about 1600 Portuguese red wines. Also included is a quality rating for each wine from blind taste-tests. How well can we predict a wine's perceived quality from these measurements?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've put all of the data preparation into this next hidden cell. It's not essential to what follows so feel free to skip it. One thing you might note for now though is that we've rescaled each feature to lie in the interval  [0,1] . As we'll discuss more in Lesson 5, neural networks tend to perform best when their inputs are on a common scale.\n"

    "Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often used in machine learning applications to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted and actual outputs. It's an inexact but powerful technique. Stochastic gradient descent is widely used in machine learning applications. Combined with backpropagation, it’s dominant in neural network training applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks find weights and biases with gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function, or loss function, is the function to be minimized (or maximized) by varying the decision variables. Many machine learning methods solve optimization problems under the surface. They tend to minimize the difference between actual and predicted outputs by adjusting the model parameters (like weights and biases for neural networks, decision rules for random forest or gradient boosting, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent algorithms are a modification of gradient descent. In stochastic gradient descent, you calculate the gradient using just a random small part of the observations instead of all of them. In some cases, this approach can reduce computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online stochastic gradient descent is a variant of stochastic gradient descent in which you estimate the gradient of the cost function for each observation and update the decision variables accordingly. This can help you find the global minimum, especially if the objective function is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch stochastic gradient descent is somewhere between ordinary gradient descent and the online method. The gradients are calculated and the decision variables are updated iteratively with subsets of all observations, called minibatches. This variant is very popular for training neural networks.\n",
